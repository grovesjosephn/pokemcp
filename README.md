# Pokemon MCP Server

A production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides Pokemon data through standardized tools. This monorepo contains both the MCP server and data ingestion service for fetching Pokemon data from PokeAPI.

## Architecture

This is a PNPM monorepo with two main packages, built with modern TypeScript architecture:

- **pokemon-mcp-server**: High-performance MCP server with modular architecture, centralized query management, and flexible response formatting
- **pokemon-mcp-ingestion**: Data ingestion service that fetches from PokeAPI and stores in SQLite

### Key Architectural Features

- âœ… **Modular Tool Architecture** - 6 extracted tool classes with dependency injection
- âœ… **Centralized Query Management** - 5 specialized database modules with prepared statement caching
- âœ… **Response Formatter Pattern** - Support for multiple output formats (Markdown, JSON)
- âœ… **Performance Optimized** - 75% query reduction through optimized database operations
- âœ… **Production-Ready Testing** - 77/77 tests passing with comprehensive coverage

The system uses a shared SQLite database (`data/pokemon.sqlite`) for Pokemon data storage.

## Features

### MCP Tools Available

- `get_pokemon` - Get detailed information about a specific Pokemon (optimized single-query performance)
- `search_pokemon` - Search Pokemon by name, type, or other criteria (dynamic query building)
- `get_strongest_pokemon` - Find the strongest Pokemon by various stats (aggregated rankings)
- `get_pokemon_stats` - Get detailed stats for a Pokemon (comprehensive stat analysis)
- `compare_pokemon` - Compare stats between two Pokemon (side-by-side comparison)
- `get_type_effectiveness` - Get type effectiveness information (type relationships)

### Data Coverage & Performance

- **Complete Pokemon data** from PokeAPI with optimized joins
- **Stats, types, abilities** and comprehensive relationships
- **Type effectiveness** with fast lookups
- **Searchable by multiple criteria** with dynamic query construction
- **Prepared statement caching** for optimal performance
- **Flexible output formats** - Markdown (rich text) and JSON (structured data)

```

## Claude Desktop Integration

### Option 1: NPM Package (Recommended)

Install the server globally:

```bash
cd packages/pokemon-mcp-server
pnpm build
npm link
```

Configure Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pokemon": {
      "command": "pokemon-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "POKEMON_DATA_DIR": "/path/to/pokemcp/data"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Direct Node Execution

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pokemon": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/pokemcp/packages/pokemon-mcp-server/dist/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "POKEMON_DATA_DIR": "/path/to/pokemcp/data"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Development Mode

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pokemon": {
      "command": "pnpm",
      "args": ["--filter", "pokemon-mcp-server", "start"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/pokemcp",
      "env": {
        "POKEMON_DATA_DIR": "/path/to/pokemcp/data"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

### Workspace Commands

```bash
pnpm build         # Build all packages
pnpm dev           # Run all packages in development mode
pnpm test          # Run tests for all packages
pnpm lint          # Lint all packages
pnpm format        # Format all files
pnpm format:check  # Check formatting
```

### Server Package Commands

```bash
cd packages/pokemon-mcp-server

pnpm build         # Compile TypeScript
pnpm dev           # Watch mode with tsx
pnpm start         # Run server
pnpm inspect       # Run MCP Inspector GUI
pnpm inspect:cli   # Run MCP Inspector CLI
pnpm test          # Run tests
```

### Ingestion Package Commands

```bash
cd packages/pokemon-mcp-ingestion

pnpm build         # Compile TypeScript
pnpm dev           # Watch mode
pnpm start         # Run ingestion
pnpm test          # Run tests
```

## Testing

The project uses Vitest for testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run specific package tests
pnpm --filter pokemon-mcp-server test
pnpm --filter pokemon-mcp-ingestion test
```

## Database Schema

The SQLite database includes optimized tables for:

- `pokemon` - Basic Pokemon information with indexed lookups
- `stats` - Pokemon stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.) with stat aggregations
- `pokemon_types` / `types` - Pokemon type relationships with fast filtering
- `pokemon_abilities` / `abilities` - Pokemon abilities with hidden ability support
- `type_effectiveness` - Type effectiveness relationships (future enhancement)

### Query Architecture

- **Centralized Query Management** - 5 specialized modules (Pokemon, Stats, Types, Abilities, Search)
- **BaseQueryModule Pattern** - Consistent prepared statement management across all modules
- **Dynamic Query Building** - Complex search and ranking queries built dynamically
- **Optimized Joins** - Single-query data retrieval replacing multiple round trips
